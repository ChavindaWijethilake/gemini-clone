# Gemini Clone

A React-based application that aims to replicate the user interface and basic functionality of **Google Gemini**, leveraging an external API for conversational AI capabilities and ICE (likely referring to Interactive Communication Elements or a similar UI library) for a smooth user experience. This project focuses on building a familiar and intuitive chat interface.

## Features
- Clean and minimalist chat interface similar to Gemini.
- Ability to send text prompts to an AI API.
- Displaying AI-generated responses in a conversational format.
- Clear distinction between user input and AI output.
- Potentially includes features like code highlighting or markdown rendering of AI responses.
- Responsive design for use on various devices.

## Tech Stack
- **React** - Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **[Specify API Name Here]** - API for providing the conversational AI model (e.g., a custom-built API, an open-source alternative API if one exists and is suitable).
- **[Specify ICE Library/Techniques Here]** - Library or techniques used for creating interactive and smooth UI elements (this could be a UI component library, custom CSS animations, or state management strategies focused on responsiveness).
- **Tailwind CSS** (Optional, but likely for rapid styling) - Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **[Other relevant libraries, e.g., for markdown rendering]**
